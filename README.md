# StreamlitExample  

Example of a **[Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/)** application used to introduce concepts of **Data-driven System Engineering**, **MLOps**, and **Pattern Recognition**.  

This repository is used as teaching material in different courses:  
- **University of Trieste (UNITS)**  
  - Data-driven System Engineering  
  - MLOps  
- **Universidade Estadual de Londrina (UEL – Brazil)**  
  - Pattern Recognition  

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Demonstrate how to quickly build interactive prototypes for experimenting with data and models.  
- Introduce **MLOps practices** in the prototyping of machine learning pipelines.  
- Explore **pattern recognition examples** in a visual and easy-to-use environment.  

---

## 🛠️ Requirements

- Python 3.9+  
- [Streamlit](https://docs.streamlit.io/)  
- Other dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`  

Install dependencies with:  

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
